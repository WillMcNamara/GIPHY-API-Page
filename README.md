# GIPHY-API-Page

This webpage comes with a predefined set of buttons which load 10 gifs from the GIPHY API
Users can also add to that set of buttons using the form in the top right

The most trouble I ran into in coding was getting some of the on click functions to work.
One thing that was helpful was adding a document ready function around my script,
but what was more useful was learning the new syntax I used for click functions.
When new buttons were written into the html by the JS, the on click functions wouldn't work initially,
but changing the click functions syntax, they would work for all buttons created, not just the ones initially on the page.

Otherwise coding felt fairly simple, it was mostly just applying what we learned in a
few activities to a complete project.
